-- reflection

-- Transaction History (Triggers for changin adresses)
-- procedures to update/change adresses
-- view for invoice kundname + productname + price + total ammount (when the date is the same) or just add it in orders?
-- make a repport from those views

-- to reach warehouse, product and status you need to do a nested join!

-- things for the reflection:
-- it's hard to make inserts and updates for tables that are higly normalised
-- made a table for Transations but noticed that I don't need one for orders to get a transaction history
